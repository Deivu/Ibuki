- Client Support
  - Any client that has support for Lavalink v4 will work. Do note that only the endpoints I mentioned in Rest part of this readme are supported, means other endpoints will return 404
  - One example client that has support for Lavalink v4 is [Shoukaku](https://github.com/shipgirlproject/Shoukaku) and will work as a drop in replacement

- Cases you may want to try Ibuki
  - You want something that runs natively on your system without additional overhead

## Contributing
- The dev enviroment used in this project is
  - Windows
  - Rust toolchain: `nightly-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`
  - Cmake: `3.31.7`
- This should enable you to fork, compile and test the project before opening a PR

## Configuration

- Just put a `config.json` beside the executable
- An example config file is available at [example-config.json](https://github.com/Deivu/Ibuki/blob/master/example-config.json) or below

```json
{
    "port": 8080,
    "address": "0.0.0.0",
    "authorization": "heavy-cruiser-ibuki",
    "playerUpdateSecs": 30,
    "statusUpdateSecs": 10,
    "deezerConfig": {
        "decryptKey": "your-decrypt-key",
        "arl": "your-arl-token"
    },
    "youtubeConfig": {
        "usePoToken": true,
        "useOauth": false,
        "cookies": "your-cookies-string"
    },
    "httpConfig": {}
}
```

- Source configuration like `deezerConfig`, `youtubeConfig`, and `httpConfig` can be disabled by removing them from the json. Here is an example below if we only want to enable `httpConfig`
  - Do note that httpConfig don't have additional configuration for now, hence if you want to enable it, leaving an empty object will do.

```json
{
    "port": 8080,
    "address": "0.0.0.0",
    "authorization": "heavy-cruiser-ibuki",
    "playerUpdateSecs": 30,
    "statusUpdateSecs": 10,
    "httpConfig": {}
}
```
